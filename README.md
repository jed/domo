dōmo: Markup, style, and code in one language
=============================================

dōmo lets you write HTML markup CSS styles in JavaScript syntax, in the browser and on the server. At **less than 1.4kb** of minizipped JavaScript, dōmo is a simpler, easier, and more reliable alternative to template engines and CSS pre-processors. And it works well with all the tools you already use, from jQuery to Backbone.js to CoffeeScript.
